# Project: CV

## 1. Project Analysis

### User Profile
To create an optimized experience, we have defined a user persona for our website. The target user is a young professional looking to learn more about my skills and professional experience, similar to an online portfolio or resume. This user likely accesses the site on both mobile and desktop devices and values a clear, easy-to-navigate design that allows them to quickly find relevant information.

### Information Architecture
The information architecture is organized into a simple multi-page structure, improving usability and navigation. Each page is dedicated to a specific aspect of the professional profile:
1. **Objectives** - Describes professional goals.
2. **Education** - Lists academic achievements and completed courses.
3. **Languages** - Shows language proficiency levels.
4. **Experience** - Lists relevant work experience.
5. **Other** - Includes any additional relevant information (e.g., technical skills).
The top navigation bar allows users to move easily between these sections, ensuring that all information is just a click away.

### Visual Design
The visual design follows a clean and minimalist approach, using neutral colors (like grays and white) for the background and contrasting colors (like yellow) for interactive elements. This ensures sufficient contrast and improves readability. We use a sans-serif font that is modern and easy to read. The design is fully responsive, adapting well to both desktop and mobile screens. The top navigation bar provides easy access to all key sections, enhancing the user experience.
